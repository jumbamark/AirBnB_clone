## Overview
The goal of this project is deploy a clone of [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/) on a server.

* The application is composed of a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### The console
The console is a command interpreter that allows you to manipulate data without a visual interface. It let's us manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter and store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

* `BaseModel` is a class that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.
* The `base_model.py` file contains the BaseModel class.
* `__init__.py` file lets Python interpreter know that a directory contains code for a Python module.
* `tests` directory contains tests for the project.

The console validates this stoage engine.
